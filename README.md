# Password_generator_homework
## About the project.
* The sole reason for this project is to help people/companies that deal with a lot of sensitive and personal information and are required to change password every few days or weeks come up with a strong password. Coming up with a strong password password sounds like an easy task, but it becomes a little difficult when you have to come up with a new password every few days or weeks.

    I started out by just having a simple html layout, added little style with css and did most of the work with java script.
